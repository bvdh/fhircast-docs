FHIRcast defines OAuth 2.0 access scopes that correspond directly to [FHIRcast events](3_Events.html). These scopes associate read or write permissions to an event. Apps that need to receive workflow related events SHOULD ask for `read` scopes. Apps that request context changes SHOULD ask for `write` scopes. Hubs may decide what specific interactions and operations will be enabled by these scopes.

Expressed in [Extended Backus-Naur Form](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:14977:ed-1:v1:en) (EBNF) notation, the FHIRcast syntax for OAuth 2.0 access scopes is:

`scope ::= ( 'fhircast' ) '/' ( FHIRcast-event | '*' ) '.' ( 'read' | 'write' | '*' )`

For example, a requested scope of `fhircast/patient-open.read` would authorize the subscribing application to receive a notification when the patient in context changed. Similarly, a scope of  `fhircast/patient-open.write` authorizes the subscribed app to [request a context change](2-5-EventNotification.html).
